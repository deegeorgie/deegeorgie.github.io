We live in data-driven world, where data has undoubtedly become the hottest commodity. Most decision-makers in business and political circles rely on insights derived from data mining to make informed decisions. 

How about our country, Cameroon? Of course we are still grappling with our age-old subjective approach! 

If you are looking for a sensationalist type of information based on rumors or fueled by some sort of score-settling motives, then this is not the place to be.

Our blogging strategy can be spaced out as follows:

- Idea or topic of interest
- Hypothesis
- Data scraping, munging
- Data exploration
- Interpretation

These points are roughly stages of a data science project life-cycle. I said “roughly” because each article won’t be a state-of-the-art project. Anyway, the source code and datasets will be made available for those interested in reproducing our analyses. 

At times, we'll embed code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Georges')
#=> prints 'Hi, Georges' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

After all, we also want to spark the interest of young students towards big data curricula. 

Stay tuned for upcoming articles. We’ll analyse twitter data on the famous Ngarbuh massacre in Cameroon, explore COVID-19 evolution and more...
